Terminal Text Editors

This task introduces us to nano and Vim in Linux

Nano 
To create a nano file in Linux, we just type 'nano filename' and it'll open the editor where you can modify the contents or text.
Some of the nano features include

Searching for text
Copying and Pasting
Jumping to a line number
Finding out what line number you are on

Vim
Vim is a much more advanced editor.
Some of Vim's benefits are
Customisability - you can modify the keyboard shortcuts to be of your choosing
Syntax Highlighting - this is useful if you are writing or maintaining code, making it a popular choice for software developers
VIM works on all terminals where nano may not be installed
Abundance of documentation
