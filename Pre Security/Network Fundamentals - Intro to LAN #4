Section 1: Intro to LAN Topologies
LAN (Local Area Network):
A network that connects devices within a limited area such as a home, school, or office.

Star Topology
Devices connect to a central hub or switch.

Pros: Easy to manage, robust—failure in one device doesn't affect others.

Cons: Central point of failure; expensive and complex to scale.

Bus Topology
All devices share a single communication line (like leaves on a stem).

Pros: Cheap and easy to set up.

Cons: Prone to bottlenecks when multiple devices transmit simultaneously; one failure can affect the whole network.

Ring Topology
Devices form a closed loop; data travels in one direction.

Pros: Less congestion, easy to trace errors.

Cons: One cable break can bring down the entire network.

Switch
Used in networks with many devices (e.g., businesses or schools).

Aggregates connections (computers, printers, etc.) through Ethernet ports.

Operates on Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model.

Router
Connects different networks and routes data between them.

Used to connect LANs to the internet or other networks.

Section 2: Subnetting Primer
Subnetting = Splitting a network into smaller, more manageable segments.

Purpose:

Improves efficiency, security, and traffic management.

Used in large networks (e.g., corporations) to organize devices.

Key Components:

Network Address – Identifies the subnet.

Host Address – Identifies specific devices in that subnet.

Default Gateway – The access point/router for leaving the subnet and reaching other networks.

Section 3: ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
Purpose:
Links IP addresses to MAC (hardware) addresses within a network.

How It Works:

Each device keeps a table (ARP cache) of known IP-to-MAC mappings.

If a device wants to send data, but doesn’t know the recipient’s MAC, it sends an ARP Request.

The correct device replies with an ARP Reply, and the data link is established.

Section 4: DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
Purpose:
Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices joining a network.

Process:

DHCP Discover – Device asks if any DHCP servers are available.

DHCP Offer – Server responds with an available IP address.

DHCP Request – Device requests to use that IP.

DHCP ACK – Server confirms and finalizes the lease.
