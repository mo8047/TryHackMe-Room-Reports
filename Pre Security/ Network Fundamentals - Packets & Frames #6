Packets vs. Frames
Packets and frames are units of data used in network communication, but at different OSI layers.

Packet – OSI Layer 3 (Network Layer). Includes IP addresses and is used to route data across networks.

Frame – OSI Layer 2 (Data Link Layer). Wraps packets with MAC address info for local delivery.

Encapsulation: Think of a packet inside a frame like a letter inside an envelope. The envelope (frame) gets opened to reveal the letter (packet).

Why packets? Splitting data into smaller pieces avoids bottlenecks and makes transmission more efficient.

IP Packet Header Fields
Time to Live (TTL): Prevents packets from circulating endlessly.

Checksum: Used for error checking.

Source IP: Where the packet came from.

Destination IP: Where the packet is going.

TCP/IP Model and the Three-Way Handshake

Network Interface

TCP – Transmission Control Protocol
TCP is a reliable, connection-based protocol. It uses the three-way handshake:

SYN – Client sends request to start communication

SYN/ACK – Server acknowledges and responds

ACK – Client confirms

TCP Packet Structure
Source and destination ports

Source and destination IP addresses

Sequence and acknowledgement numbers

Checksum

Flags (SYN, ACK, FIN, RST)

Data payload

TCP Pros and Cons
Pros:

Guarantees delivery

Orders packets

Reliable

Cons:

Slower due to connection setup and error checking

More overhead

Can block if packets are lost

TCP Connection Closing
Uses FIN and ACK packets to terminate the session.

UDP – User Datagram Protocol
UDP is a fast, connectionless protocol. No handshake, no guarantees.

Used in:

Online games

VoIP

Streaming

UDP Pros and Cons
Pros:

Fast

Low resource usage

Cons:

No guaranteed delivery

No ordering

No error recovery

Ports Overview
Ports range from 0 to 65535.
Ports 0–1023 are well-known ports.

Common Ports
FTP: 21

SSH: 22

HTTP: 80

HTTPS: 443

SMB: 445

RDP: 3389

Non-standard ports (like 8080) need to be specified explicitly in URLs.
