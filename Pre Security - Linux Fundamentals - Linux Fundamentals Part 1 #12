# Section 1 

Introduction

This was an introduction to what we will be doing in this series, including running Linux commands, etc.

## Section 2 

A Bit of Background on Linux

Where is Linux used?
Linux is used in our day-to-day life without us knowing, like in
Websites that you visit
Car entertainment/control panels
Point of Sale (PoS) systems, such as checkout tills and registers in shops
Critical infrastructures such as traffic light controllers or industrial sensors

Flavors of Linux

Linux holds multiple OS's known as distributions.
Just like Windows has Windows 7, 8, 10, etc, Linux has hundreds of distributions, like Ubuntu and Kali, used for different tasks.

## Section 3


Interacting With Your First Linux Machine (In-Browser)

In this section, we opened a Linux terminal and interacted with it.

## Section 4

Running Your First Few Commands

Linux, unlike other OS's, doesn't have a GUI therefore, interacting with the machine will be done through the Terminal
In this example, we were taught some Linux terminal commands

echo	: Output any text that we provide
whoami	: Find out what user we're currently logged in as!

## Section 5

Interacting With the Filesystem!

ls	listing
cd	change directory
cat	concatenate
pwd	print working directory

Listing Files in Our Current Directory (ls)
Changing Our Current Directory (cd)
Outputting the Contents of a File (cat)
Finding out the full Path to our Current Working Directory (pwd)

## Section 6

Searching for Files

2 commands help us ease the search for files
1.  find
2.  grep

## Section 7

An Introduction to Shell Operations.

&	This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal.
&&	This operator allows you to combine multiple commands in one line of your terminal.
>	This operator is a redirector, meaning that we can take the output from a command (such as using cat to output a file) and direct it elsewhere.
>>	This operator does the same function as the > operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten).

Operato "&"
The "&" shell operator allows us to execute a command and have it run in the background (such as this file copy), allowing us to do other things!

Operator "&&"
This shell operator is a bit misleading in the sense of how familiar it is to its partner "&". Unlike the "&" operator, we can use "&&" to make a list of commands to 
run, for example, command1 && command2. However, it's worth noting that command2 will only run if command1 was successful.

Operator ">"
This operator is what's known as an output redirector. What this essentially means is that we take the output from a command we run and send that output somewhere else.

Operator ">>"
This operator is also an output redirector, like the previous operator (>) we discussed. However, what makes this operator different is that rather than overwriting 
any contents within a file

## Section 8

Concluions & Summaries

To quickly recap, we've covered the following:

Understanding why Linux is so commonplace today
Interacting with your first-ever Linux machine!
Ran some of the most fundamental commands
Had an introduction to navigating around the filesystem & how we can use commands like find and grep to make finding data even more efficient!
 Power up your commands by learning about some of the important shell operators.
