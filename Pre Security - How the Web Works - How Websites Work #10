##Section 1 

How The Web Works.

When visiting a website the the browser requests the web server about information of the website being visited, it'll respond with data for the browser to show the website.
There are 2 aspects that make up a website:
1.  Front end: This is what your browser shows you
2.  Back end: This is what goes in the backgroung to process your request

##Section 2

HTML

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the language websites are written in. The HTML tags are the building blocks of the pages and tell the browser gow to 
display content.

There are many HTML tage with different jobs for example the <HTML> tag is the root of HTML and won't render without it, the <head> tag defines the document, 
<body> tag defines the code and everything written here is visible to the website the rest isn't.

In this exercise we did a practical modifying some HTML code to view images.

##Section 3

Javascript

Jaascript is a coding language that allows pages to become interactive HTML is used to create website structure CSS is used for designing and Javascript is used for 
interactivity. Without javascript the pages would be static and not interactive.

In this section we did a practical where we modified HTML code and added Javascript and HTML elements to it.

##Section 4

Sensetive Data Exposure

In this practical I was taught how dangerous it is to store data on the HTML code and how people with malicious intent can check the HTML
tags for sensetive information and access the website fully.

##Section 5

HTML Injection 

HTML injection is a vulnerability when unifiltered user input is displayed on the page. If a website fails to sanitise user input and that input is used on the page, 
an attacker can inject HTML code into a vulnerable website.

In this practical we did an example where we injected an HTML link and retrieved a flag from the website.
