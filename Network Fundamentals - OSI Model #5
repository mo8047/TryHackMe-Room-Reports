OSI Model – THM Room Report
Section 1 – What is the OSI Model?
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a foundational framework in networking. It defines how data is sent, received, and interpreted between systems on a network — regardless of hardware or software differences.

It has 7 layers, each with distinct responsibilities, from physical transmission to user interaction.

Section 2 – Layer 1: Physical
The Physical layer deals with the actual hardware — cables, switches, voltage levels. Data is transmitted in binary (1s and 0s) through electrical or optical signals.

Section 3 – Layer 2: Data Link
Responsible for MAC addressing and physical addressing. Every device has a NIC (Network Interface Card) with a unique MAC address burned into it.

This layer handles frame formatting and ensures the data is ready for transmission on the physical layer. It also detects basic transmission errors.

Section 4 – Layer 3: Network
Handles routing and logical addressing via IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1). Determines the best path for data packets using protocols like OSPF and RIP.

This is where routers (Layer 3 devices) operate.

Routing decisions consider:

Shortest path

Reliability

Physical medium speed (fiber vs. copper)

Section 5 – Layer 4: Transport
Manages end-to-end delivery and reliability through two main protocols:

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

Reliable, connection-oriented

Error checking and correction

Slower but accurate (used in emails, web browsing)

UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

Fast, connectionless

No guarantee of delivery

Used in streaming, gaming, DNS queries

Section 6 – Layer 5: Session
Manages sessions between devices — establishes, maintains, and terminates them. Also handles checkpoints to resume transfers if interrupted.

Sessions are unique and isolated from each other.

Section 7 – Layer 6: Presentation
Acts as a translator between different systems. It ensures data is in a usable format, regardless of how different applications handle it.

Handles encryption/decryption, compression, and formatting (e.g., JPEG, ASCII, HTML, etc.).

Section 8 – Layer 7: Application
The closest layer to the user. Defines protocols for apps like browsers, email clients, FTP clients, etc.

Also handles DNS (domain name resolution), HTTP/S, SMTP, etc.

Section 9 – Room Activity
The room included a quiz-style game where the player had to correctly match data scenarios to the corresponding OSI layer (1–7).
