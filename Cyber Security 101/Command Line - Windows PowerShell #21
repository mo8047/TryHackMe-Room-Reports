##Section 1

What is PowerShell

PowerShell is Microsoft’s cross-platform automation tool that combines a command-line shell, scripting language, and configuration management framework. Built on .NET, it’s object-oriented, 
which makes it far more powerful than traditional text-based shells like cmd.exe. Instead of plain text, commands (cmdlets) return objects with properties and methods, making data manipulation 
and system management much easier.

Why It’s Powerful
  Objects, not text → richer data handling.
  Integration with Windows APIs → deeper system control.
  Cross-platform support → works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
  PowerShell enables advanced automation, from simple file management to enterprise-level configuration
