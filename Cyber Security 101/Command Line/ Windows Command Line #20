##Section 1

Basic System Information

PATH: Windows only executes commands in directories listed in the system Path. Run set to view it.
ver: Shows OS version.
systeminfo: Displays detailed system information (OS, host, processor, memory, etc.).
driverquery: Lists installed drivers. Add | more to scroll page by page.
help [command]: Displays help for a command.
cls: Clears the terminal screen.

Tip: Use | more for long outputs and CTRL + C to exit paging.

##Section 2

Network Troubleshooting

ipconfig → Shows IP, subnet mask, and gateway. Add /all for full details (DNS, DHCP, MAC, etc.).
ping target → Tests connectivity by sending ICMP requests.
tracert target → Traces the route (hops) to a target server.
nslookup domain [server] → Resolves domain to IP (optionally specify DNS server).
netstat → Displays network connections and listening ports.
  -a → All connections & ports
  -b → Show program using each port
  -o → Show process ID (PID)
  -n → Show numeric addresses/ports

Example: netstat -abon → Full details with executables + PID

Tip: Use netstat -h to explore more options.

##Section 3

File and Disk Management

Directories
  cd → Show current directory or move into one.
  cd .. → Go up one level.
  dir → List contents (/a for hidden, /s for all subdirs).
  tree → Show folder structure visually.
  mkdir → Create a directory.
  rmdir → Delete a directory.
Files
  type file.txt → View file contents.
  more file.txt → View long files page by page.
  copy file1 file2 → Copy files.
  move file target → Move/rename files.
  del / erase file → Delete files.
  Wildcards (*) can target multiple files.
In conclusion the CLI is faster more efficient than the GUI

##Section 4

Task and Process Management

Instead of Task Manager, you can use the command line to view and kill processes. tasklist shows all running processes, and you can filter results (e.g., tasklist /FI "imagename eq sshd.exe"). 
Once you know the process ID (PID), you can end it with taskkill /PID <pid>. (FI = Filter Image, eq = equal, PID = Process ID)

The CLI provides more  control over Task Manager, especially when filtering and terminating processes directly by PID.
