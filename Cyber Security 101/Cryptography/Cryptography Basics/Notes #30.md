## Section 1 Plaintext to Ciphertext

**Plaintext** is the original, readable message or data before it’s encrypted.

**Ciphertext** is the scrambled, unreadable version of the message after encryption.

**Cipher** is an algorithm or method to convert plaintext into ciphertext and back again. 

**Key** is a string of bits the cipher uses to encrypt or decrypt data. 

**Encryption** is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using a cipher and a key.

**Decryption** is the reverse process of encryption.
