##Section 1

Windows Domains

When a business has only a few computers, you can manage them one by one. But as the company grows, this becomes impossible. A Windows Domain solves this by letting all users and computers be managed 
in one place using Active Directory (AD) with the Domain Controller (DC) handling authentication and policies. This setup makes it easier to control accounts, apply security rules, and manage 
resources across the whole network like how schools and workplaces let you log in on any computer with the same account.

##Section 2

Active Directory

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is the core of a Windows Domain.
Storing information about objects like users, machines, and groups. 
Users can represent people or services and are authenticated by the domain. Machines also get accounts (e.g., PC01$) and manage themselves within the network. 
Security groups make it easier to assign permissions to multiple users or computers at once, with built-in groups like Domain Admins, Server Operators, and Backup Operators. 
These objects are organized into Organizational Units (OUs), which mirror departments (e.g., IT, Sales) to apply policies, while groups are used for permissions. In short: OUs = policies, 
Groups = access.
