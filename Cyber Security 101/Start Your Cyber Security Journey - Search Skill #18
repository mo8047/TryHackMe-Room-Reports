##Section 1

Evaluation of Search Results

On the Internet, everyone has the ability to post and publish their writings. This can be in the form of Blog Posts, Articles, Social Media Posts, or even Wikipedia Articles.
It's our job as readers to filter out the nuisance and make sure that the content provided was written objectively by taking all the facts.
Some ways we can do so is by identifying,

Source: Identify the author or organization publishing the information. Consider whether they are reputable and authoritative on the subject matter. 
Publishing a blog post does not make one an authority on the subject.

Evidence and reasoning: Check whether the claims are backed by credible evidence and logical reasoning. We are seeking hard facts and solid arguments.

Objectivity and bias: Evaluate whether the information is presented impartially and rationally, reflecting multiple perspectives. We are not interested in authors pushing 
shady agendas, whether to promote a product or attack a rival.

Corroboration and consistency: Validate the presented information by corroboration from multiple independent sources. Check whether multiple reliable and reputable sources 
agree on the central claims.

##Section 2

Search Engines.

Almost every search engine allows the user for advanced search.

Advanced search commands in Google include.
"exact phrase": Double quotes indicate that you are looking for pages with the exact word or phrase. For example, one might search for "passive reconnaissance" to get pages with this exact phrase.

site:: This operator lets you specify the domain name to which you want to limit your search. For example, we can search for success stories on TryHackMe using site:tryhackme.com success stories.

-: The minus sign allows you to omit search results that contain a particular word or phrase. For example, you might be interested in learning about the pyramids, but you don’t want to view 
tourism websites; one approach is to search for pyramids -tourism or -tourism pyramids.

filetype:: This search operator is indispensable for finding files instead of web pages. Some of the file types you can search for using Google are Portable Document Format (PDF), Microsoft
Word Document (DOC), Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet (XLS), and Microsoft PowerPoint Presentation (PPT). For example, to find cybersecurity presentations, try searching for filetype:ppt 
cyber security.

##Section 3

Specialized Search Engine.

There are specialized search engines that find specific type of results.

Shodan
a search engine for devices connected to the Internet. It allows you to search for specific types and versions of servers, networking equipment, industrial control systems, and IoT devices.

Censys
focuses on Internet-connected hosts, websites, certificates, and other Internet assets.

VirusTotal
an online website that provides a virus-scanning service for files using multiple antivirus engines. 

Have I Been Pwned
Have I Been Pwned does one thing; it tells you if an email address has appeared in a leaked data breach. 

##Section 4

Vulnerabilities and Exploits

CVE
We can think of the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program as a dictionary of vulnerabilities. It provides a standardized identifier for vulnerabilities and security issues 
in software and hardware products. Each vulnerability is assigned a CVE ID with a standardized format like CVE-2024-29988. This unique identifier (CVE ID) ensures that everyone from 
security researchers to vendors and IT professionals is referring to the same vulnerability.

Exploit Database
The Exploit Database lists exploit codes from various authors; some of these exploit codes are tested and marked as verified.

GitHub
a web-based platform for software development can contain many tools related to CVEs, along with proof-of-concept and exploit codes. 

##Section 5

Technical Documentation

Linux (man pages): Use man <command> to access built-in manuals for commands, system calls, libraries, and config files (e.g., man ip). Quit with q.
Windows: Microsoft provides official technical docs (e.g., searching ipconfig on the MS Docs site).
Product Documentation: Popular tools (Snort, Apache, PHP, Node.js, etc.) maintain official docs as the most reliable, up-to-date source.
Key Skill: Always check official documentation first—it’s complete, authoritative, and current.

##Section 6

Social Media

Social media is useful for learning about people, companies, and new cybersecurity trends. Use a temporary email to explore safely, and don’t share personal info that could be used by 
attackers. Follow trusted pages and news sites to stay updated.
