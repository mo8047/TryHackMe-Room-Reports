##Section 1

Evaluation of Search Results

On the Internet, everyone has the ability to post and publish their writings. This can be in the form of Blog Posts, Articles, Social Media Posts, or even Wikipedia Articles.
It's our job as readers to filter out the nuisance and make sure that the content provided was written objectively by taking all the facts.
Some ways we can do so is by identifying,

Source: Identify the author or organization publishing the information. Consider whether they are reputable and authoritative on the subject matter. 
Publishing a blog post does not make one an authority on the subject.

Evidence and reasoning: Check whether the claims are backed by credible evidence and logical reasoning. We are seeking hard facts and solid arguments.

Objectivity and bias: Evaluate whether the information is presented impartially and rationally, reflecting multiple perspectives. We are not interested in authors pushing 
shady agendas, whether to promote a product or attack a rival.

Corroboration and consistency: Validate the presented information by corroboration from multiple independent sources. Check whether multiple reliable and reputable sources 
agree on the central claims.
