TLS

TLS (Transport Layer Security): securing communications on the Internet (successor to SSL)

History: SSL (1995) -> TLS (1999), now at TLS 1.3 (2018) with major improvements.
Function: Encrypts traffic (confidentiality + integrity) at the transport layer.
Impact: Enables safe banking, shopping, email, messaging — prevents packet sniffing/password theft.
Adoption: Many protocols gained secure versions -> HTTPS, SMTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, DoT (DNS over TLS).

Certificates:

  Signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) to prove authenticity.
  Trusted CA certificates preinstalled in browsers/OS.
  Free option: Let’s Encrypt.
  Self-signed certs work but don’t guarantee authenticity.
