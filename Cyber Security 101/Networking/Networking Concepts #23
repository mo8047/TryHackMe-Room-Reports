##Section 1

OSI Model

The OSI (Open System Interconnections) comprises of 7 layers

1. Physical layer
2. Data Link layer
3. Network layer
4. Transport layer
5. Session layer
6. Presentation layer
7. Application layer

This can also be memorized by a mnemonic "Please Do Not Throw Spinach Pizza Away"

1. Physical layer

Layer 1 of the OSI model. It handles the physical connections (wires, fiber, Wifi signal, etc.) It defines how bits are transmitted at either electrical, optical or radio signal.
E.g. Ether cable, Wifi bands(2.4Ghz, 5Ghz, 6Ghz), Fiber optics and Ether cables.

2. Data Link layer

Layer 2 of the OSI model describe how data on the same network segment are transferred, using protocols like Ethernet(802.3) and WiFi(802.11). Each device has it's own unique MAD address
(Media Access Control) which consists of 6 bites each 2 separated by a colon (:), where the first 3 are the address of the vendor (Intel, AMD, etc.) and the last 3 are the device's MAC address 
(a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d). In communication every frame has a destination and a source MAC address.

3. Network layer

Layer 3 of the OSI model handles sending data betweend ifferent networks. Through routing and logical addressing. In the data link(layer 2) layer it transmits data between an office 
connected in a network, whilst in the network layer(layer 3) it controls the data through different offices, countries and continents.

4. Transport layer

Layer 4 of the OSI model enables end to end communication between running applications on different hosts. For example the web browser is connected to a website over the transport layer. 
Which supports various functions like flow control, error correction and segmentation.

5. Session layer

Manages communication sessions between applications on different hosts. It establishes, maintains, and synchronizes communication, ensuring data is transmitted in order and can recover from 
failures. Examples: NFS (Network file system), RPC (Remote procedure call).

6. Presentation Layer

Formats data so the application layer can understand it. Handles encoding, compression, and encryption. Examples: character encoding (ASCII, Unicode), image formats (JPEG, PNG) 
and MIME for email attachments.

7. Application Layer

Provides network services to end-user applications. Examples include HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP, POP3, IMAP. Your browser, email client, or other apps interact with this layer directly.
