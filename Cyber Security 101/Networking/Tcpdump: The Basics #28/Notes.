##Section 1

Basic Packet Capture

The following commands are an introductory to how to use tcpdump in filtering

tcpdump -i INTERFACE	Captures packets on a specific network interface
tcpdump -w FILE	Writes captured packets to a file
tcpdump -r FILE	Reads captured packets from a file
tcpdump -c COUNT	Captures a specific number of packets
tcpdump -n	Don’t resolve IP addresses
tcpdump -nn	Don’t resolve IP addresses and don’t resolve protocol numbers
tcpdump -v	Verbose display; verbosity can be increased with -vv and -vvv

##Section 2

Filtering Expressions

There are multiple ways to filter using 'tcpdump', those include Filtering by Host, filtering by Port, Filtering by Protocol and we also have tha capability of using logocal operations to 
modify our filtering command further. Those include (and, or, not)

tcpdump host IP or tcpdump host HOSTNAME = Filters packets by IP address or hostname
tcpdump src host IP =	Filters packets by a specific source host
tcpdump dst host IP	= Filters packets by a specific destination host
tcpdump port PORT_NUMBER = Filters packets by port number
tcpdump src port PORT_NUMBER = Filters packets by the specified source port number
tcpdump dst port PORT_NUMBER = Filters packets by the specified destination port number
tcpdump PROTOCOL = Filters packets by protocol; examples include ip, ip6, and icmp
