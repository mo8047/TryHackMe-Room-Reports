**Intro to LAN topoligies.**


LAN stands for local area network

**Star Topology**
The Star topology refers to a central network where devices connect to and communicate through. Issues consist of high maintainance when it's scalled and issues when failure,
although the star topology is robust therefore it's hard for it to fail.

**Bus Topology**
Bus Topology is when and entire network is connected through a single cable. Like a tree where the computers are the leaves and they are connected through the stem.
An area of failure is when each computer requests data simelaneousley the topology is prone to becoming slow, although they are cheap to set up and maintain.

**Ring Topology""
Ring topology is when computers are connected with eachother in a ring. Unlike Bus topology they are less prone to bottleecks because the data sent is one directional so it
has to pass a computer before reaching it's intended location, they are also easy to troubleshoot because they are one-directional so it's easier to dissect and find the issues.
A point of failure is if a cable is cut or broken then the entire network fails.

**Switch**
Switches are primarily found in large businesses, schools or organizations places where there are a lot of connected devices. Switches are used to aggregate multiple devices
such as computers, printers, phones, etc at once using a single ethernet.

In this excercise was a mock site which explained LAN topologies, their weaknesses and capture the flag.

**Router**
It's a router's job to connect networks and pass data between them as the name suggests routing.

#Section 2

A primer on subnetting

Subnetting splits the network  into smaller miniature networkswhithin itself to sort of streamline taske efficiently and make the load on the network lower.
Usually found in businesses where they have a large amount of devices connected to their network, think printers, phones, computers and cameras.
Subnets use the IP address to 
1. Indentify the network address
2. Identify the Host address
3. Identify the default gateway

Each of these networks is reponsible for their own set of tasks, where the Network address identifies the start of the actual network and identify the network's existence.
Whereas Host networks uses a device IP to identify a device on the subnet and the default gateway is a special address assigned on the network that is capable of sending 
information to another network.
