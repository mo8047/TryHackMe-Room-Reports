Section 1: Packets & Frames
ðŸ”¹ Packets vs. Frames (OSI Model)
Frame (Layer 2 â€“ Data Link):
Used for communication within the local network.
Contains MAC addresses (no IP).
Think: Inner envelope.

Packet (Layer 3 â€“ Network):
Used for routing between networks.
Contains IP addresses.
Think: Outer envelope.

â†’ Encapsulation: Data is wrapped in headers at each OSI layer. Reverse process = decapsulation.

Why Use Packets?
Efficiency: Splits data to avoid congestion.

Reassembly: Receiver reconstructs the original data (e.g., image or video).

Packet Structure (IP Example)
Header	Description
TTL	Limits packet lifespan across networks.
Checksum	Verifies integrity (detects corruption).
Source IP	Origin device address.
Destination IP	Target device address.

TCP/IP vs OSI
TCP/IP model = simplified OSI (4 layers):

Application

Transport

Internet

Network Interface

TCP vs UDP
ðŸ”¹ TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
Connection-based (uses 3-way handshake).

Guarantees data delivery, order, and integrity.

Slower but reliable.

Key TCP Headers:
Source/Destination Port

Source/Destination IP

Sequence & Acknowledgment Number

Flags (SYN, ACK, FIN, RST)

Checksum

Data

ðŸ“¶ TCP 3-Way Handshake
SYN (Client â†’ Server): Initiates connection.

SYN/ACK (Server â†’ Client): Accepts and syncs.

ACK (Client â†’ Server): Confirms.
â†’ Then data can be exchanged.

ðŸ”š TCP Termination
FIN â†’ ACK â†’ FIN â†’ ACK
Both sides cleanly agree to close the connection.

ðŸ”¹ UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
Stateless, connectionless.

No guarantees of delivery or order.

Faster, used where speed > reliability (e.g., video, voice).

UDP Headers:
TTL

Source/Destination IP

Source/Destination Port

Data

UDP Pros:
Lightweight, fast, no connection overhead.

UDP Cons:
No delivery/ordering guarantee, bad on poor connections.

Ports
Numerical values between 0â€“65535.

Well-known ports: 0â€“1023 (standardized)

ðŸ”‘ Common Ports
Protocol	Port	Use
FTP	21	File sharing
SSH	22	Secure remote shell
HTTP	80	Web (unencrypted)
HTTPS	443	Web (encrypted)
SMB	445	File/printer sharing
RDP	3389	Remote desktop GUI
