Section 1: What Are Packets and Frames?
Packets and frames are chunks of data used to transmit information over a network, but they exist at different layers of the OSI model:

Frame (Layer 2 – Data Link Layer):
Contains MAC addresses and operates within a local network segment. No IP addresses involved.
Think of it like the inner envelope.

Packet (Layer 3 – Network Layer):
Contains IP addresses. Used for routing data between different networks.
This is the outer envelope used to mail the message.

This structure is called encapsulation—data is wrapped in multiple layers of headers and trailers as it moves through the network stack.

Why Use Packets?
Efficiency: Data is broken into smaller pieces to avoid network congestion.

Reassembly: Like puzzle pieces, packets are reassembled on the receiving end.

Example:
A cat image from a website is broken into packets → each travels independently → reassembled into the full image on your device.

Packet Structure (IP Example)
Header	Description
Time to Live (TTL)	Prevents a packet from circulating forever. Counts down each hop.
Checksum	Ensures data integrity. Detects corruption in transmission.
Source Address	The sender’s IP address.
Destination Address	The recipient’s IP address.
